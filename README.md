Shiny app to compare 2 players' Statistics from FIFA 2019 Dataset

This creates an interactive plot to compare the capabilities of two players at a time from the FIFA 19 dataset. 
Thirty-three qualities are compared and the use of Plotly makes the graph created more interactive.
It is thus easier to compare the skill ratings given to two players in the game.
